# Joint_Reconstruction_Synthetic_MR

This is a source codes in MATLAB and Python to reproduce some of the results that are described in the paper: "Accelerated multi-contrast reconstruction for Synthetic MRI using Joint Parallel Imaging and Variable Splitting Network". For any questions about the code, please contact me (Kanghyun Ryu) at: kanghyun@stanford.edu
